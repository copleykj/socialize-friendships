# Friendships #

Provides social network style Friend Requests and Friendships.


## Requests ##

Requests are created by calling `user.requestFriendship` where `user` is an instance fo the user class. The request will be created as a request from the currently logged in user to the user requresented by `user`. When retrieved from the database records are converted to instances of the `Request` class which gives access to the methods of the class.

### Request (class) - Extends [BaseModel](https://github.com/copleykj/socialize-base-model)  ###

To gain access the methods of a request you must first have an instance of a request. You can obtain an instance by performing a query on the requests collection. A `findOne` will return an instance and a `find` will return a cursor which when iterated over will return an instance for each iteration. Ways of obtaining instances that belong to the current user are provided as extensions to the `User` class and are detail in the [User Extension](#user-extensions) section of this document

```javascript
var request = Meteor.requests.findOne(); //instance of Request

var requests = Meteor.requests.find();  //cursor which returns Request instances
```
#### Instance Methods ####

_**all examples assume an instance of `Request` as `request`**_

**requester** - Get the user instance for the user who requested the friendship.

```javascript
var requester = request.requester(); //instance of user for person making the request
```

**user** - Get the user instance for the user who's friendship is being requested.

```javascript
var user = request.user(); //instance of user who the request was sent to
```

**accept** - Accept a friend request. Only works if the user of the request is the currenly logged in user.

```javascript
request.accept(); //accept the request
```

**deny** - Deny a friend request. Only works if the user of the request is the currenly logged in user. Request won't be allowed to be re-made for `User.restrictRequestDays` Days. Default is 30 days.

```javascript
request.deny(); //deny the request
```

**cancel** - Cancel a friend request. Only works if the requester of the request is the currently logged in user.

```javascript
request.cancel(); //cancel the friend request
```

**wasRespondedTo** - Check to see if the request has been responded to (denied or ignored).

```javascript
request.wasRespondedTo(); //true if the request was responded to.
```


## Friends ##

### Friend (class) - Extends [BaseModel](https://github.com/copleykj/socialize-base-model)  ###

To gain access the methods of a friend you must first have an instance of a friend. You can obtain an instance by performing a query on the friend collection. A `findOne` will return an instance and a `find` will return a cursor which when iterated over will return an instance for each iteration. Ways of obtaining instances that belong to the current user are provided as extensions to the `User` class and are detailed in the [User Extensions](#user-extensions) section of this document

```javascript
var request = Meteor.friends.findOne(); //instance of Request

var requests = Meteor.friends.find();  //cursor which returns Request instances
```
#### Instance Methods ####

_**all examples assume an instance of `Friend` as `friend`**_

**user** - The User instance for the friend.

```javascript
friend.user(); //the user instance for the friend instance.
```

## User Extensions ##
This package extends the [socialize:user-model](https://github.com/copleykj/socialize-user-model) package with properties and methods that apply the the user in the context of friends and friend requests.

_**All code examples assume an instance of `User` as `currentUser`**_

```javascript
var currentUser = Meteor.user();
```

### Instance Methods ###

```html
{{#each currentUser.requests}}
<div class="request">
    <p>{{requester.username}} would like to be friends</p>
    <p>
        <a href="#" data-action="accept">Accept</a>
        <a href="#" data-action="deny">Deny</a>

## Publications ##

Previous verions of this package provided convenient publications for publishing related data. Over the life of the package though, I have come to realize that publications are too application specific and you should not be locked in to a specific join package for the publications to be pre packaged. Instead publication examples can be found on the [github wiki page for this package](https://github.com/copleykj/socialize-friendships/wiki/Publications).
