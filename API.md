## Friends ##

### Friend (class) - Extends [BaseModel](https://github.com/copleykj/socialize-base-model)  ###

To gain access the methods of a friend you must first have an instance of a friend. You can obtain an instance by performing a query on the friend collection. A `findOne` will return an instance and a `find` will return a cursor which when iterated over will return an instance for each iteration.

Other methods for retaining information about friends or interacting with friends pertaining to the current user are also available on the User class and are detailed in the [User Extensions](#user-extensions) section of this document.

```javascript
var request = Meteor.friends.findOne(); //instance of Request

var requests = Meteor.friends.find();  //cursor which returns Request instances
```

_**All code examples in this section assume an instance of `Friend` as `friend`**_

**user** - The User instance for the friend.

```javascript
friend.user(); //the user instance for the friend instance.
```

## User Extensions ##
This package extends the [socialize:user-model](https://github.com/copleykj/socialize-user-model) package with properties and methods that apply the the user in the context of friends and friend requests.

```javascript
var currentUser = Meteor.user();
```

**friendRequests(options)** - Get the requests to the user. Returns a Mongo.Cursor which yields `Request` instances. Signature of `options` param is the same as you would pass to `Collection.find()`.

```html
{{#each currentUser.friendRequests}}
<div class="request">
    <p>{{requester.username}} would like to be friends</p>
    <p>
        <a href="#" data-action="accept">Accept</a>
        <a href="#" data-action="deny">Deny</a>
        <a href="#" data-action="ignore">Ignore</a>
    </p>
</div>
{{/each}}
```

**numFriendRequests** - The number of remaining requests to the user

```html
<div class="badge success">{{currentUser.numFriendRequests}}</div>
```

    </p>
{{/each}}
```

**numPendingRequests** - Get the number of requests that have not been responded to.

```html
<p>
    You have {{currentUser.numPendingRequests}} requests to other users pending.
</p>
```

<!-- assuming data context is user instance -->
{{#if currentUser.hasFriendshipRequestFrom this}}
    <div class="btn primary" data-action="accept">Accept Request</div>
